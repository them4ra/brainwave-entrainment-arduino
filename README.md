This is a very basic sketch for the Arduino where you can get it to flash LED lights at certain frequencies. 

The Brainwave Entrainment Device
This sketch makes LED lights connected to pin 9 flash at a certain frequency. In the area marked "Options" inside the sketch you can change the flash intensity in hertz.

The set up I use has the LEDs in series but you could easily alter this to have a seperate LED connected to two different pins. 

A rough outline for ranges are:

Delta 0.5–4 Hz
Theta 4–7 Hz
Alpha 7.5–12.5 Hz
Beta 12.5-30 Hz 
Gamma 25-100 Hz

A study lead by Li-Huei Tsai used a LED strip flickering 
at 40 hz to increase gamma activity in mice:

"Using this device, the researchers found that an hour of exposure to light 
flickering at 40 hertz enhanced gamma oscillations and reduced beta amyloid 
levels by half in the visual cortex of mice in the very early stages of Alzheimer’s.
However, the proteins returned to their original levels within 24 hours."

WARNING:
Do not use this on yourself or others and if you do, all responsiblity is on you!
